Module:
    Data::Peek - A collection of low-level debug functions

Description:
    Modified and extended wrapper functions to make debugging more
    pleasureable.

    DDumper is a wrapper around Data::Dumper with always sorted keys.
    The output is however reflowed and not parseable anymore (in most
    cases) as the quotation around the keys is removed.

    DDump is a wrapper around perl's core function sv_dump (), which
    should enable you to use the output instead of the default behaviour
    that only prints to STDERR.

    DPeek is a wrapper around internals Perl_sv_peek

    DDump_IO is a wrapper around perl's core function do_sv_dump (),
    which acts like sv_dump (), but to a PerlIO stream, which is only
    available in perl 5.8 and higher.
